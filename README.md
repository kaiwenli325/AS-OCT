# AS-OCT

This repository provides the code for the multitask network in "Comprehensive assessment of anterior segment in refraction corrected OCT based on multitask learning".

We are applying for copyrights for the refraction correction and parameter computation. A software for these two functions will be released afterward and you can also implement them by yourself according to our paper.
